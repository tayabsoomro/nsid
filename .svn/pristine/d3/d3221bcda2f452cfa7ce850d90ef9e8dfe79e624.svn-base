### Introduction

# nsid is a program that checks against NSIDs provided in either standard input,
# passed in as arguments to the program, or added as input file. It prints the
# NSID given and whether it is valid or not.


### Program Structure

# This program uses is_nsid function that takes in as parameter potential NSID
# and returns 0 if it is a valid NSID and 1 otherwise. Then there is a wrapper
# script that gets input from standard input, using cat command, if no arguments
# are provided and from arguments if they are provided. For each of the value
# that it receives, regardless of how they are obtained, it evaluates and prints
# out appropriate message.
